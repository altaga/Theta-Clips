Welcome, we are Theta Clips.

Theta Clips is an NFT marketplace where streamers, creators, gamers and their audience can easily and quickly upload short videos of their best moments and turn them into NFTs.

# Introduction

NFTs have exploded into the world scene with huge valuations but most of it have been focusing on digital art-work.

It is true that we have huge companies like the NBA with top shots and now even Disney, Tiktok and Instagram ready for the taking of this growing market. Nevertheless there are few instances where there have been real disruptors in this space.

Streaming and Esports have become huge and growing. According to Business Insider, it is expected to grow at a 9% CAGR up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023. The esports audience will grow on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million.

Streaming is another monster, in Twitch only Traffic continued to grow, with 1.5 million broadcasters and 100 million monthly viewers in 2015, rising to 2.2 million broadcasters and 15 million daily viewers in 2018. 

Twitch broadcasters, perhaps most famously Ninja, have featured on the cover of ESPN. Esports tournaments have drawn hundreds of thousands of concurrent viewers, with millions of dollars in prize money funded partly through the huge audience on Twitch.

They have made an estimated $2.3 billion revenue in 2020, primarily from subscriptions and IAP with its more than 9 million users and its 18.6 billion hours of content that was consumed on the platform in 2020.

One of the aspects that has made it transcend is the ability for its audience to interact with games, like “clipping” videos, predictions in which the audience can vote and so forth. We think this is an element that is limiting the mass adoption of Theta.tv.

This is a huge market that has been overlooked by NFT marketplaces...until now.

Enter Theta Clips, an NFT marketplace and addon where streamers, creators, gamers and its audience can easily and quickly upload short videos of their best moments and turn them into NFTs.


# Our Solution

Our Theta Clips page is already operational and ONLINE. It has all the basic functions of any NFT marketplace but of course, based around streaming moments.

Let skim through our landing page and the marketplace, it is a common NFT dashboard with a couple more perks. For example here is the link to the topic on Theta.tv that resulted in this NFT.

In turn, the NFT and its contract can be viewed on the Theta Explorer.

The most important part of the project is for the creator to be able to upload a video moment of their stream or content and quickly make it into an NFT. 

But above all, for the streamer to interact with its audience by allowing them to create their own NFTs!

To view the NFTs you don't require an account, however in order to participate in all the interactive tools we provide you’ll need a Metamask account.

Uploading your NFT is as simple as connecting your metamask account and going through the entire process of uploading the file to NFT.storage and mint which happens on the backend. For now we have a cap of 15 seconds for each Clip, but  it'll grow in the future.   

### Minting

The process of minting and uploading an NFT through Theta is as follows, this is all running on the Theta Smart Contracts Testnet! 

First, we must deploy the NFT contract, this contract handles the bids, NFT transfer and mint.

 Once the contract is displayed on the Theta network explorer, the form will appear to fill in all the NFT data and upload the file.

### Authorizing

But this process will not be complete until the creator gives its approval. On our webpage the creator will receive a notification for pending authorization of certain NFTs. For them to enter the marketplace they have to be authorized and signed using Metamask. This keeps things fair and favouring the creator-streamer always.

# How we've built it

System's Achitecture:

This is a comprehensive take on how the system's built, you can take a look into our Github where you'll find the codebase.

# What's next for Theta Clips

There are Marketplaces for great sports moments created by the NBA and one coming for the NFL, but of course this is heavily centralized and controlled. We can do a similar concept through streaming platforms, gaming and creators with THETA CLIPS but of course in a much more decentralized way where the NFT belongs not to a company, but to the people that mint and buy it.

Regarding streaming platforms as acknowledged by our research, interactivity from the audience with the streamer is paramount for its adoption and I think Theta can excel among platforms by incorporating ideas and projects such as this one.

Hopefully you liked the project!
